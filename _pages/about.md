<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a PhD student in Finance at the University of Melbourne. I hold a Master of Journalism and Communication from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and a Master of Management Studies from the University of Southern California. My previous research spans culture, social media, and emerging financial technologies. 
In my free time, I enjoy art and music; I play a little guitar and piano, and I also sketch and paint.
